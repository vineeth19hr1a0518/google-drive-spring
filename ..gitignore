# Spring Boot application properties (if you have local-specific sensitive configs)
# If your application.properties contains sensitive data specific to your local setup
# that shouldn't be in Git, you might ignore it and use environment variables locally too,
# or use application-local.properties ignored and application.properties committed.
# For now, if it only has root-folder-id and app-name, it's generally okay to commit.
# If you put your JSON key content in app.properties, definitely ignore it.
